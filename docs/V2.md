# Bare client documentation

## Importing the library

The API for the client was designed with all use-cases in mind. You should be able to import the library into your code without changing how it's bundled/the module type.

In order to accomplish this, we provide two versions of the client:

- ESM - ECMAScript modules, `import` syntax
- CommonJS - CommonJS modules, `require()` syntax

We encourage the use of modern JavaScript and recommend using ESM if you're starting a new project/codebase. _But you don't have to._

### Browsers/Deno (ESM)

Deno is a potential environment for the Bare client. It supports `fetch()` and `import`ing web URLs

But usually, this is done in browsers

```html
<script type="module">
	// type="module" indicates that this script uses ESM
	// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#applying_the_module_to_your_html
	import { createBareClient } from 'https://unpkg.com/@tomphttp/bare-client@2.0.0-beta/dist/index.js';
</script>
```

### Browsers (CommonJS)

Bare client has an alternative API that gives you access to all the exports in the `bare` variable.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@tomphttp/bare-client@2.0.0-beta/dist/bare.cjs"></script>
<script>
	bare.BareClient; // class...
	bare.createBareClient; // function...
</script>
```

### Module

This can be done in NodeJS v17+ (`fetch()` api was added natively) or via a bundler.

Bundlers include: webpack, rollup

Install with NPM:

```sh
npm i @tomphttp/bare-client
```

```js
import { BareClient, createBareClient } from '@tomphttp/bare-client';
```

### Module (CommonJS)

```js
const { BareClient, createBareClient } = require('@tomphttp/bare-client');
```

## Bare manifests

This concept is fundamental to understanding what API to use for creating an instance of BareClient.

Bare servers have a manifest that expose JSON data that help the client determine what versions of the Bare server are supported.

Here's an example:

https://uv.holyubofficial.net/

```json
{
	"versions": ["v1", "v2", "v3"],
	"language": "NodeJS",
	"memoryUsage": 22.84,
	"project": {
		"name": "bare-server-node",
		"description": "TOMPHTTP NodeJS Bare Server",
		"repository": "https://github.com/tomphttp/bare-server-node",
		"version": "2.0.0-beta"
	}
}
```

This will be fetched one way or another by the client. The link to the manifest is used as a base URL for the client.

It's expected that APIs such as `./v2/` relative to the manifest URL.

## Creating a BareClient instance

Now that you have access to `BareClient` and `createBareClient`, you have several ways to utilize the library.

### Synchronously

One of the APIs for `new BareClient()`:

```ts
class BareClient {
	// ...
	/**
	 * Lazily create a BareClient. Calls to fetch and connect will request the manifest once on-demand.
	 * @param server A full URL to the bare server.
	 * @param signal An abort signal for fetching the manifest on demand.
	 */
	// ...
}
```

Usage:

```js
const client = new BareClient("https://uv.holyubofficial.net/"); // string
const client = new BareClient(new URL("https://uv.holyubofficial.net/")); // accepts instances of `URL`
```

If you have your Bare server on http://example.com/bare/, and the page is on example.com, you might be tempted to do:

```js
const client = new BareClient('/bare/');
```

**_THIS WILL NOT WORK!_**

```
Uncaught TypeError: URL constructor: /bare/ is not a valid URL.
```

This is because you need to pass a full URL. Here's a few examples:

```js
// Similar to passing `/bare/`, except it's being resolved using the `location` and `URL` api:
const client = new BareClient(new URL("/bare/", location.toString()));

// A more compact solution that's slightly less recommended:
// location.origin will always be http://example.com
// There's no `/` at the end of the origin so this will work.
const client = new BareClient(`${location.origin}/bare/`);
```

#### on-demand mode

If you don't pass a manifest to `new BareClient`, `BareClient` will enter on-demand mode.

on-demand mode is as such:

The client won't know what version of the Bare server is supported until the manifest is fetched. The manifest won't be fetched until `client.fetch` is called. Because `client.fetch` is asynchronous, the API doesn't change when on-demand mode is enabled. If the manifest fails to be fetch, an error will be thrown in `client.fetch`. If an error was thrown, the client will try to fetch the manifest the next time `client.fetch` is called. **_`client.createWebSocket`_** won't work unless the manifest has been fetched.

`client.createWebSocket` not working unless `client.fetch` was called should be a huge deal depending on your use-case. If you don't expect to be creating a WebSocket from that environment (you're probably in a Service Worker), on-demand mode is perfect. If it's still a big deal, see [Synchronously with cache](#synchronously-with-cache) and [Asynchronously](#asynchronously)

### Synchronously with cache

Other API for `new BareClient()`:

```ts
class BareClient {
	// ...
	/**
	 * Immediately create a BareClient.
	 * @param server A full URL to the bare server.
	 * @param manfiest A Bare server manifest.
	 */
	constructor(server: string | URL, manfiest?: BareManifest);
	// ...
}
```

You can re-use the Bare server manifest from one instance to another.

For example, this code won't work due to the Bare client being in on-demand mode:

```js
const client = new BareClient('https://uv.holyubofficial.net');

// Uncaught TypeError: You need to wait for the client to finish fetching the manifest before creating any WebSockets. Try caching the manifest data before making this request.
while (true) client.createWebSocket('wss://www.google.com/');
```

However, this code will:

```js
// takes some time to fetch the manifest
const firstClient = await createBareServer('https://uv.holyubofficial.net');

// instant
const secondClient = new BareClient(
	'https://uv.holyubofficial.net',
	firstClient.manifest
);

// you're free to create all the WebSockets you want...
while (true) secondClient.createWebSocket('wss://www.google.com/');
```

The manifest is serializable and can be passed from a Service Worker to a client (this is a use-case for TompHTTP Service Worker proxies).

```js
const secondClient = new BareClient(
	'https://uv.holyubofficial.net',
	JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(firstClient.manifest))
);
```

### Asynchronously

This will fetch the manifest before making the BareClient available to you. The returned client is guaranteed to work with `.createWebSocket`.

```js
// takes some time to fetch the manifest
const client = await createBareServer('https://uv.holyubofficial.net');

// but it's worth it
// now you're free to create all the WebSockets you want...
while (true) client.createWebSocket('wss://www.google.com/');
```

## Making requests

The client exposes a fetch-like API:

```ts
class BareClient {
	// ...
	async fetch(
		url: urlLike | Request,
		init?: RequestInit
	): Promise<BareResponseFetch>;
	// ...
}
```

Example:

API used in this example: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create

```js
// const client = ...

async function openaiCompletions(OPENAI_API_KEY, prompt) {
	const res = await client.fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/completions', {
		method: 'POST',
		headers: {
			'content-type': 'application/json',
			authorization: `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
		},
		body: JSON.stringify({
			model: 'text-davinci-003',
			prompt,
			max_tokens: 7,
			temperature: 0,
		}),
	});

	return res.json();
}

const res = await openaiCompletions(
	'my-api-key-asjkdioasopd',
	'Say this is a test'
);
console.log(res); // {id: ...,choices: [{...}]}
```

All the fields of RequestInit and Request are supported in `client.fetch`, however, there are some drawbacks:

### Your headers will be lost

If you're passing an instance of `Request` to `fetch`, you're going to lose several headers. Some known headers are: `user-agent`, `cookie`, and `set-cookie`. There's probably more. This seems to be because the `Request` API sanitizes the headers of any unsafe values. The `Headers` API is uneffected if it isn't derived from a `Request` instance.

The solution: Pass your own headers in addition to passing `Request`.

#### Example:

GitHub's API blocks requests without a user-agent, making it a good way to test if we lost the user-agent header.

Broken code:

```js
const req = new Request('https://api.github.com/orgs/tomphttp', {
	// We pass 'headers' to the Request constructor.
	headers: {
		'user-agent': navigator.userAgent,
	},
});

const res = await client.fetch(req, {
	headers: new Headers(),
});

console.log(res.status); // 403. this is because user-agent was lost
```

Working:

```js
const req = new Request('https://api.github.com/orgs/tomphttp');
const res = await client.fetch(req, {
	headers: new Headers({
		'user-agent': navigator.userAgent,
	}),
});
// We pass (url: Request, init: RequestInit)

console.log(res.status); // 200!
console.log(await res.json()); // {login: 'tomphttp', id: 98234273, ... }
```

## Connecting to WebSockets
